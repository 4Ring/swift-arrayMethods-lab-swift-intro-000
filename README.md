> When someone tells me "no," it doesn't mean I can't do it, it simply means I can't do it with them.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Know when and how to use the following methods on arrays:
	* `append()`
	* `insert(_:atIndex:)`
	* `removeAtIndex()`
	* *subscript syntax* with arrays
	* `count`
	* `isEmpty`
	
## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* `append()`
	* `insert(_:atIndex:)`
	* `removeAtIndex()`
	* *subscript syntax* with arrays
	* `count`
	* `isEmpty`
  

## Outline / Notes

*  I've included the playground file. This lesson could range anywhere between 10-15 questions.
* This should build in complexity giving them some easy wins with the first few questions. This probably could reach 20 questions if you feel you're cramming too much in the earlier questions to encompass all they learned.
